## Session - Setup & RedNote Cover Tool

### Gmail/Google - Dead End
- jzclaws1@gmail.com got suspended by Google (bot detection)
- Can't create new Gmail (phone number limit)
- Decision: skip email for now, Jason forwards stuff via chat

### Infrastructure Fixes
- gogcli config was mounted into sandbox but permissions were 700 (owner-only)
- Fixed with chmod 755/644
- Had to docker rm the sandbox container to pick up bind mount (restart not enough)
- gog OAuth client is disabled (account suspended) so still can't use Gmail

### Notion Connected
- API key: stored at .config/notion/api_key
- Videos Schedule database accessible
- data_source_id: 60ca6609-300e-4d66-8548-b7ad9c9df98d

### RedNote Skill Imported
- Unzipped and wrote 13 files to chinese-social-scripts/
- Includes: script generator, optimizer, cover design guide, writing style guide, sample script

### Cover Image Generator - Started
- Jason wants automated cover creation for RedNote videos
- Requirements: background + product photos (with auto bg removal) + title → finished cover
- Also wants product info auto-fetched from URLs/links
- Python env set up: Pillow, requests, beautifulsoup4, Chinese fonts (Noto Sans SC)
- rembg won't work in sandbox (needs >2GB RAM) — need alternative
- XiaoHongShu ID: 100137741 — can't scrape directly (needs login)

### Pending
- Waiting for Jason's video to create first cover
- Need to build the actual cover generator script
- Voice messages not supported (no ffmpeg in sandbox)

## 2026-02-01 Session

### Cover Generator v1 → Scrapped
- Built wrong thing: fancy gradient/decoration covers, not XHS style
- Jason's actual style: video frame + bold text overlay + stroke
- Lesson: ALWAYS research first, don't guess and build
- Downloaded refs from Jason's account (焦言蛋白 Johanne) + big bloggers (柯基吃烤鱼, 洪成成_橙橙子)
- Built v2: overlay_cover.py with gradient text, glow, stroke effects
- Still needs refinement based on Jason's feedback
- XHS needs cookies for access (can't scrape without login)

### Kalshi Flow Completed
- `research.py` — auto news search, GDPNow, SCOTUS cal, Congress, Polymarket cross-check
- `portfolio.py` — position tracking, P&L, trade history
- `notify.py` — updated with --research flag, better state persistence
- Full pipeline: scan → research → notify → track

### Jason's Alt Account
- Johanne Jiao (Telegram id: 7952782207) = Jason's other account, trusted

### MEMORY.md Created
- Set up long-term memory file
- BOOTSTRAP.md emptied (can't delete due to permissions)
