## 2. Market Structure Analysis

### Resolution Mechanism
1. **Primary**: Video/audio of the event (broadcast, livestream, call recording)
2. **Secondary**: Transcripts from source agencies (if video consensus can't be reached)
3. **Arbiter**: Consensus of Kalshi employees
4. **Source agencies**: Listed in contract (typically major news outlets)

### What Counts as a "Mention"?
- The **exact word or phrase** must be stated
- **Plurals and possessives** count (e.g., "immigrant" includes "immigrants" and "immigrant's")
- Other tense inflections do **NOT** count (e.g., "running" doesn't count for "run")
- Hyphenated compounds do **NOT** count
- Synonyms do **NOT** count
- For slashed phrases (e.g., "Doge/Dogecoin"), **either word** satisfies
- For Trump weekly/monthly: public statements, direct quotes from source agencies, or personal social media (Twitter/Truth Social) count
- Executive Orders and bills signed do **NOT** count
- For event-specific: only the live broadcast counts (previous recordings aired during event don't count)

### Market Mechanics
- **Type**: Binary (Yes/No), $1 payout
- **Pricing**: Linear cent (1¢ increments)
- **Early close**: Markets can close early if the word IS mentioned (for "will say" markets)
- **Settlement timer**: 1,800 seconds (30 min) after event ends
- **Notional**: $1.00 per contract

### Volume Distribution

## 3. Historical Patterns & Edge Analysis

### Key Observations

#### 1. YES Overpricing by Retail
- In **weekly/monthly** Trump markets, already-resolved YES markets show at 100¢ (Transgender ✓, Windmill ✓, Crypto/Bitcoin ✓, DEI/Woke ✓, Pelosi ✓, TrumpRX ✓)
- For common Trump vocabulary, **YES is almost always correct** on monthly/weekly timeframes
- The edge is in **identifying which words Trump WON'T say** — selling YES on obscure/unlikely words

#### 2. Event-Specific Markets Are Different
- SOTU/press conferences: Scripted speech + extemporaneous remarks
- Trump is known for going off-script → more likely to mention unusual topics
- SOTU historically covers foreign policy, economy, culture war topics
- "Crypto/Bitcoin" at 39¢ for SOTU is interesting — Trump has been very pro-crypto but SOTU speeches are typically more formal

#### 3. Volume Concentrates on Controversy
- Highest volume in "entertainment" bets: "Will Trump say Sleepy Joe?" ($45K), "Will Trump mention Somalia?" ($55K), "Crypto/Bitcoin" ($59K)
- Controversial/surprising outcomes attract more liquidity
- The WH Press Briefing "Stupid Question" at 6¢ has $95K volume — massive interest in low-probability outcomes

#### 4. Spreads and Liquidity
- Tight spreads on high-volume markets (1-2¢ on SOTU markets)
- Wider spreads on low-volume/niche markets (10-40¢ on Olympics, Mamdani)
- Significant market maker activity providing 2-sided quotes
- Average liquidity per market: $3K-$130K depending on series

#### 5. Early Close Mechanism Creates Unique Dynamics
- Once a word is mentioned, the market closes at 100¢ immediately
- This creates a **binary option** dynamic: YES holders get instant payout
- NO holders lose everything the moment the word is said
- For weekly/monthly markets, this means early YES bets on common words have very fast payoffs

### Strategy Recommendations

#### Strategy 1: "Sure-Thing YES" on Weekly/Monthly
- Buy YES on words Trump is highly likely to say (>90% historical probability)
- Target words like: Tariff, China, Illegal, MAGA, Fake News on weekly timeframes
- Expected return: Small but very consistent (e.g., buy at 85¢, collect $1 in days)
- Risk: Low, but you're tying up capital for small returns

#### Strategy 2: "Contrarian NO" on SOTU Unlikely Words
- Sell YES (or buy NO) on words Trump is unlikely to say in a formal SOTU
- Examples: "UFC" (39¢ YES), "Windmill" (42¢ YES), "Palestine" (13¢ YES)
- SOTU speeches are typically 60-90 minutes, scripted
- But Trump goes off-script frequently → higher risk
- Use historical SOTU transcripts to estimate word probability

#### Strategy 3: Event-Driven Scalping
- Buy underpriced YES immediately before/during events when news breaks
- E.g., if tariff news breaks before SOTU, buy "Tariff" mention YES
- Requires real-time monitoring of Trump's Truth Social, news feeds
- Fast execution needed (Kalshi API for automated trading)

#### Strategy 4: Portfolio Approach to SOTU
- Buy a basket of high-confidence YES positions (>70% implied prob)
- Diversify across 10-15 words, each $50-100
- Expected: Most resolve YES during SOTU, a few miss
- Net positive expected value if average win rate > implied probability

#### Strategy 5: WH Press Briefing Arbitrage
- Press briefings happen frequently (weekly or more)
- Already-resolved YES markets show predictable patterns
- Biden, ICE, Illegal, Border, FBI, Kristy all already at 100¢
- Track previous briefing transcripts to build word probability model

#### Strategy 6: Earnings Call Edge
- Earnings calls are more predictable than political speech
- Company-specific jargon is highly likely (e.g., Coinbase saying "Bitcoin" → 94¢)
- Obscure words offer NO-side edge (e.g., "Saudi Arabia" on EA call → 2¢)
- Pre-read earnings guidance and press releases to predict language

### SOTU Deep Dive (Feb 25, 2026)
The **State of the Union** is the single biggest mention market event:
- 94 individual markets across words, places, and people
- $568K in cumulative volume already, expected to grow significantly
- Trump's speaking style (off-script tangents) makes many outcomes uncertain
- **Key betting opportunities**:
  - "Crypto/Bitcoin" at 39¢ — Trump is pro-crypto but SOTUs typically don't cover it
  - "Sleepy Joe" at 48¢ — Classic Trump insult, but may be "beneath" SOTU dignity
  - "Somalia" at 51¢ — Hot topic due to deportation flights, uncertain
  - "UFC" at 39¢ — Very unlikely in formal SOTU
  - "Vaccine" at 44¢ — RFK Jr. era, possible but not certain
  - "Biden" at 90¢ — Almost certain mention

## 5. Polymarket Status

**Polymarket does NOT have mention/say markets.** Extensive search of their API across multiple query terms (mention, tweet, say, word, truth social, speech, post) returned zero relevant results. This is a **Kalshi-exclusive market category**.

Polymarket focuses on outcome-based prediction markets (elections, geopolitics, sports outcomes, crypto prices) rather than word/phrase mention tracking.

## 8. Risk Assessment

### Key Risks
1. **Kalshi fees**: Not fully transparent (JS-rendered page), but typically 1-7¢ per contract depending on tier
2. **Liquidity risk**: Many mention markets have thin books; large positions can move the market
3. **Resolution disputes**: Kalshi employee consensus can be subjective for edge cases
4. **Inflection ambiguity**: "Run" vs "running" — the exact boundary matters
5. **Early close timing**: If a word is mentioned, your NO position goes to zero instantly
6. **Event cancellation**: If SOTU is postponed, unclear how markets resolve

### Opportunity Size
- **SOTU alone**: $568K current, likely $1M+ by event day
- **Total mention category**: ~$6.5M+ in cumulative volume across all series
- **Weekly recurring**: Press briefing + Trump weekly = ~$500K per cycle
- **Earnings calls**: ~$4.3M (heavily EA-dominated)

---

## 9. Actionable Next Steps

1. **Immediate (today)**: Monitor KXTRUMPMENTIONB markets (Feb 6 announcement closes tomorrow)
2. **This week**: Position for Super Bowl mentions (KXNFLMENTION, $929K volume, Feb 9)
3. **This week**: Build SOTU mention strategy (Feb 25) — analyze historical SOTU transcripts
4. **Ongoing**: Set up automated monitoring of Trump Truth Social for weekly market edge
5. **Build**: Kalshi API polling script for all mention series to track price changes
6. **Build**: Historical SOTU transcript word counter to calibrate probabilities
