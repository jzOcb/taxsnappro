Commit Message:
Add automatic skill update feedback loop + semi-automatic mode

This is a META enforcement improvement:
- Detects when enforcement improvements happen
- Auto-creates tasks to update skills
- Semi-automatic commit with confirmation

Action needed:
1. Review the enforcement workflow improvements (3 scripts + 1 doc)
2. Extract the automatic feedback loop pattern
3. Add to skills/agent-guardrails/:
   - New script: create-skill-update-loop.sh (for other projects to install)
   - Reference doc: skill-update-feedback.md
   - Update SKILL.md: Document the new meta-enforcement pattern
4. Commit skill changes
5. Mark this task done

Why this matters:
This is THE solution to "enforcement improvements don't flow back to skills."
Every project should be able to install this feedback loop.
