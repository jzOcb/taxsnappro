- Federal income tax: ~$127,000
- Additional Medicare Tax (0.9% on wages > $250K): ~$2,700
- NIIT (3.8% on $35K investment income, since MAGI > $250K): ~$1,330
- **Total Federal: ~$131,000**

**Massachusetts:**
- MA income tax (5% flat): ~$30,000
- (Millionaire's surtax does NOT apply — income under $1M)
- **Total MA: ~$30,000**

**Combined baseline: ~$161,000**

## 2. Retirement Account Optimization

### Strategy 2A: Max 401(k) Contributions — Both Spouses
**Limit:** $23,500 per person (2025); $7,500 catch-up if age 50+; $11,250 catch-up if age 60-63

| Scenario | Contribution | Federal Savings | MA Savings |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Both under 50 | $47,000 | $16,450 (35%) | $2,350 (5%) |
| Both 50+ | $62,000 | $21,700 (35%) | $3,100 (5%) |
| One 60-63 | $34,750 (one) | $12,163 (35%) | $1,738 (5%) |

**Math (both under 50):**
- $23,500 × 2 = $47,000 pre-tax
- At 35% marginal federal bracket: $47,000 × 0.35 = **$16,450 federal savings**
- At 5% MA rate: $47,000 × 0.05 = **$2,350 MA savings**
- **Total savings: $18,800/year**

**Action items:**
- ✅ Verify both employers allow max deferral
- ✅ Set contribution to hit max by year-end (not front-load unless employer does true-up)
- ✅ Traditional 401(k) is STRONGLY preferred over Roth 401(k) at this income level — you're in the 35% bracket now, likely 22-24% in retirement

### Strategy 2B: Max HSA Contributions (Family)
**Limit:** $8,550 family (2025); +$1,000 catch-up per person 55+

The HSA is the single best tax-advantaged account available — **triple tax advantage:**
1. **Tax-deductible contributions** (reduces AGI)
2. **Tax-free growth** (invest in index funds)
3. **Tax-free withdrawals** for qualified medical expenses (at any age) or any purpose after 65

**Math:**
- $8,550 contribution
- Federal savings: $8,550 × 0.35 = **$2,993**
- MA savings: $8,550 × 0.05 = **$428**
- FICA savings: $8,550 × 0.0145 (Medicare only at this income) = **$124** (only if contributed through employer payroll)
- Avoids NIIT: reduces MAGI
- **Total savings: ~$3,545/year**

**Requirements:**
- Must have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
- 2025 HDHP minimum deductible: $3,300 family; max out-of-pocket: $16,600 family
- Cannot be enrolled in Medicare
- Cannot be claimed as dependent

**Pro tip:** Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket now, keep receipts, let HSA grow invested, reimburse yourself years later tax-free. No time limit on reimbursement.

### Strategy 2C: Backdoor Roth IRA — Both Spouses
At $500K+ income, you're above the Roth IRA income phaseout (2025: $236,000-$246,000 MAGI for MFJ). But you can still get money into a Roth via the backdoor:

**Step-by-step:**
1. Contribute $7,000 to a **Traditional IRA** (non-deductible, since you have a workplace plan and income > $126K)
2. File Form 8606 documenting the non-deductible contribution
3. Convert the Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (ideally next day, before gains)
4. Pay tax on any gains between contribution and conversion (usually negligible)
5. Repeat for spouse — **Spousal IRA** with same $7,000 limit

**⚠️ PRO-RATA RULE — CRITICAL:**
If you have ANY pre-tax money in ANY Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRA, the conversion is partially taxable. The IRS treats ALL your IRAs as one pool.

**Example of pro-rata problem:**
- You have $93,000 in a rollover Traditional IRA (pre-tax)
- You contribute $7,000 non-deductible to Traditional IRA
- Total IRA balance: $100,000 (93% pre-tax, 7% after-tax)
- You convert $7,000 to Roth → only 7% ($490) is tax-free, 93% ($6,510) is taxable

**Fix:** Roll any existing Traditional/SEP/SIMPLE IRA balances INTO your 401(k) before year-end. This removes pre-tax IRA money from the pro-rata calculation.

**Tax savings:**
- $7,000 × 2 = $14,000 into Roth
- No immediate tax savings, but tax-free growth for life
- At 7% return over 20 years: $14,000 → ~$54,000 tax-free
- Tax savings on growth: ~$54,000 × 0.35 = **~$14,000 avoided over 20 years** (per year of contributions)

### Strategy 2D: Mega Backdoor Roth
If your employer's 401(k) plan allows **after-tax contributions** (not Roth 401(k) — different thing) AND **in-service distributions or in-plan Roth conversions**, you can contribute up to the total 401(k) limit ($70,000 in 2025) minus your employee deferrals and employer match.

**Example:**
- Employee deferral: $23,500
- Employer match: $10,000
- Room for after-tax: $70,000 - $33,500 = **$36,500**
- Convert $36,500 to Roth → tax-free growth forever

**How to check if your plan allows it:**
1. Call your 401(k) administrator
2. Ask: "Does the plan allow after-tax (non-Roth) contributions?"
3. Ask: "Does the plan allow in-service withdrawals or in-plan Roth conversions of after-tax contributions?"
4. Both must be "yes"

**Tax savings (long-term):**
- $36,500/year growing tax-free at 7% for 20 years = ~$141,000
- Tax avoided on gains: ~$141,000 × 0.35 = **~$37,000 per year of contributions over 20 years**

### Strategy 2E: Traditional vs Roth 401(k) at $500K+ Income
**Strong recommendation: Traditional (pre-tax) 401(k)**

**Reasoning:**
- Current marginal rate: 35% federal + 5% MA = **40% combined**
- Expected retirement rate: 22-24% federal + 5% MA = **27-29% combined**
- Spread: **11-13 percentage points** in your favor with Traditional
- On $47,000/year: saves **$5,170-$6,110/year** vs Roth

**Exception:** If you expect income to rise significantly (>$751K taxable) or tax rates to increase dramatically, Roth may make sense for diversification. Consider putting 10-20% in Roth for tax diversification, not 100%.

## 3. Rental Property Tax Optimization

### Strategy 3A: Depreciation (Straight-Line, 27.5 Years)
Residential rental property is depreciated over **27.5 years** using the straight-line method.

**What qualifies:**
- The building/structure itself
- Improvements that become part of the building
- NOT land (land is never depreciable)

**Land vs. Building Split:**
- Use the property tax assessment to determine the split
- Typical residential: 75-85% building, 15-25% land
- Alternative: get an appraisal (costs $300-$500)
- IRS may challenge if ratio is unreasonable

**Example:**
- Purchase price: $500,000
- Land value: $100,000 (20%)
- Depreciable basis: $400,000
- Annual depreciation: $400,000 ÷ 27.5 = **$14,545/year**
- Tax savings at 35% federal: **$5,091/year**
- Tax savings at 5% MA: **$727/year**
- **Total depreciation tax benefit: ~$5,818/year**

**Important:** Depreciation is mandatory for rental property — you must take it (or recapture it when you sell, regardless of whether you claimed it).

### Strategy 3B: Cost Segregation Study
A cost segregation study reclassifies components of a building into shorter depreciation lives:

| Component | Normal Life | Accelerated Life |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Building structure | 27.5 years | 27.5 years |
| Land improvements (parking, landscaping) | 27.5 years → | 15 years |
| Personal property (appliances, carpet, fixtures) | 27.5 years → | 5 or 7 years |

**When it makes sense:**
- Property cost > $500,000 (building portion)
- Study costs $5,000-$15,000 for residential
- Typical result: 15-25% of building value reclassified to 5-15 year property

**Example on $400K building:**
- 20% reclassified to 5-year property = $80,000
- 5-year depreciation: $80,000 ÷ 5 = $16,000/year (vs. $2,909/year under 27.5)
- Acceleration benefit in year 1: **$13,091 additional deduction**
- Tax savings: $13,091 × 0.40 (fed + MA) = **~$5,236 in year 1**

**⚠️ BUT:** For this couple at $500K+ AGI, passive activity loss rules likely SUSPEND most of these deductions (see 3D below). The benefit is deferred, not lost.

### Strategy 3C: Bonus Depreciation (2025)
Under TCJA, bonus depreciation is **phasing down:**

| Year | Bonus Depreciation % |
|------|---------------------|
| 2022 | 100% |
| 2023 | 80% |
| 2024 | 60% |
| **2025** | **40%** |
| 2026 | 20% |
| 2027 | 0% |

**Application to rental property:**
- Bonus depreciation applies to the **personal property** and **land improvements** identified in a cost segregation study (5, 7, and 15-year property)
- Does NOT apply to the building structure itself (27.5-year property)

**Example (2025, 40% bonus):**
- Cost seg identifies $80,000 of 5-year property
- Bonus depreciation (40%): $80,000 × 0.40 = $32,000 first-year deduction
- Remaining $48,000 depreciated over 5 years normally
- Year 1 total: $32,000 + $9,600 = **$41,600 deduction** (vs. $2,909 without cost seg)

### Strategy 3D: Passive Activity Loss Rules (IRC §469) — THE BIG ISSUE

**This is the most important section for your situation.**

At $500K+ AGI, rental losses are almost certainly **suspended** under passive activity loss rules:

**The $25,000 Allowance:**
- Active participants in rental real estate can deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against non-passive income
- **BUT** this phases out between $100,000 and $150,000 AGI
- Phase-out: $0.50 per $1 of AGI over $100K
- At $150K+ AGI: **$0 allowance**
- **At $500K+ AGI: NO rental losses can offset W-2 income** under this rule

**What happens to suspended losses:**
- They carry forward indefinitely
- Released when: (a) you have passive income, (b) you dispose of the property entirely

**Can rental losses EVER offset W-2 income at $500K+?**
→ YES, but ONLY if you qualify as a **Real Estate Professional (REPS)**

### Strategy 3E: Real Estate Professional Status (REPS)

**Requirements (ALL must be met):**
1. More than **750 hours** per year in real estate activities
2. More than **50% of personal services** performed in real estate trades or businesses
3. **Material participation** in each rental activity (typically >500 hours, or >100 hours and more than anyone else)

**What counts as "real estate activities":**
- Property management, maintenance, repairs
- Searching for/acquiring properties
- Developing, redeveloping, constructing
- NOT counting time as an investor/studying market

**Documentation requirements:**
- Contemporaneous time log (daily or weekly)
- Date, hours, activity description
- IRS frequently challenges REPS — documentation is CRITICAL
- Calendar entries, emails, photos with timestamps all help

**Reality check for W-2 employees:**
- If both spouses work full-time W-2 jobs, REPS is nearly impossible
- One spouse would need to work ≤ 750 hours at their W-2 job and ≥ 750 hours in real estate
- Part-time spouse or non-working spouse is the typical path

**If you qualify:**
- ALL rental losses become non-passive → deductible against W-2 income
- With cost segregation: could create $30,000-$50,000+ in losses
- Tax savings: $40,000 × 0.40 = **$16,000/year**

**If you DON'T qualify (most likely for dual W-2 earners):**
- Losses are suspended and carry forward
- Consider: can one spouse reduce to part-time? Worth $16K+/year in tax savings

### Strategy 3F: Repair vs. Improvement Rules
Repairs are immediately deductible; improvements must be capitalized and depreciated.

**Safe Harbor Elections (file with tax return):**
1. **De Minimis Safe Harbor:** Items < $2,500 per invoice/item can be expensed immediately (or < $5,000 if you have audited financial statements)
2. **Routine Maintenance Safe Harbor:** Recurring activities to keep property in operating condition (painting, HVAC servicing, etc.)
3. **Small Taxpayer Safe Harbor:** If building's unadjusted basis ≤ $10M AND total repairs/improvements ≤ lesser of $10,000 or 2% of unadjusted basis → can deduct all

**Examples:**
| Repair (Deductible Now) | Improvement (Capitalize) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Fix a leaky faucet | Remodel entire bathroom |
| Patch roof | Replace entire roof |
| Paint rooms | Add a room/addition |
| Replace broken window | Replace all windows |
| HVAC repair/tune-up | Install new HVAC system |

### Strategy 3G: Other Rental Deductions
All of these are deductible on Schedule E:

| Deduction | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Mortgage interest (rental property) | Fully deductible — NO SALT cap applies |
| Property taxes (rental property) | Fully deductible — NOT subject to $10K SALT cap |
| Insurance premiums | Landlord policy, umbrella |
| Property management fees | Typically 8-10% of rent |
| HOA dues | If applicable |
| Travel to rental property | Mileage (70¢/mile 2025) or actual expenses |
| Advertising for tenants | Listing fees, photos |
| Legal and accounting fees | Related to rental |
| Utilities (if landlord-paid) | Water, sewer, trash |
| Pest control, landscaping | If landlord responsibility |

## 4. High-Income Specific Strategies

### Strategy 4A: Reducing Additional Medicare Tax
**The tax:** 0.9% on earned income (wages + self-employment) exceeding $250,000 MFJ

**Your exposure:** ($550,000 - $250,000) × 0.009 = **$2,700**

**Limited ways to reduce:**
- ❌ Cannot be reduced by 401(k) contributions (applies to Medicare wages, not taxable wages)
- ❌ Not reduced by HSA contributions via payroll (HSA reduces FICA, but Additional Medicare Tax is on total compensation)
- ✅ Shift income from earned to unearned (but triggers NIIT — different 3.8% tax)
- ✅ If self-employed: maximize business deductions to reduce SE income
- **Bottom line:** Very difficult to reduce for W-2 employees. Budget ~$2,700.

### Strategy 4B: Reducing Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)
**The tax:** 3.8% on the lesser of: (a) net investment income, or (b) MAGI exceeding $250,000

**Your exposure:** Lesser of $35,000 investment income or ($600,000 - $250,000) = $350,000 → 3.8% × $35,000 = **$1,330**

**Strategies to reduce:**
1. **Maximize above-the-line deductions** to reduce MAGI (401k, HSA)
   - After maxing 401k + HSA: MAGI drops by ~$55,550 but still well above $250K
   
2. **Tax-loss harvesting** reduces net investment income directly
   - Harvest $10,000 in losses → reduces NII by $10,000
   - NIIT savings: $10,000 × 0.038 = **$380**

3. **Municipal bond interest** is excluded from NII
   - Shift $100K from taxable bonds (3% yield) to MA munis
   - Saves: $3,000 × (0.35 + 0.038 + 0.05) = **$1,314/year**

4. **Rental income with sufficient deductions** can bring net rental to $0 or negative (reducing NII)

5. **Qualified retirement plan distributions** are NOT investment income
   - Favor 401(k) growth over taxable account growth

### Strategy 4C: AMT Planning
**2025 AMT for MFJ:**
- Exemption: $137,000
- Exemption phaseout starts at: $1,252,700 AMTI
- 26% rate up to $239,100 excess; 28% above

**At $600K income:**
- Your AMTI is well below the exemption phaseout threshold
- After $137K exemption, most of your income may still be below AMT rates
- **AMT exposure is likely minimal** for W-2 earners at this income level
- Main AMT triggers (ISO exercises, large itemized deductions) should be monitored

**Action:** Run AMT calculation through tax software before year-end. Major triggers:
- Incentive stock option (ISO) exercises
- Large state/local tax deductions (add back for AMT, but capped at $10K anyway)
- Private activity bond interest

### Strategy 4D: SALT Cap Workaround — MA PTE Election
Massachusetts enacted a Pass-Through Entity (PTE) tax election (effective 2021+) that allows eligible pass-through entities to pay an entity-level state income tax.

**How it works:**
- If you have an S-corp, partnership, or LLC taxed as a pass-through
- The entity elects to pay MA income tax at the entity level (5%)
- You get a federal deduction for the state tax paid (bypasses SALT cap)
- You get a MA credit for the tax paid by the entity
- Net effect: converts a capped itemized deduction into an unlimited business deduction

**Applicability to your situation:**
- ❌ Does NOT apply to W-2 wages — must have pass-through business income
- ✅ If rental property is held in an LLC taxed as partnership or S-corp, may qualify
- ✅ If either spouse has consulting/side business through S-corp
- Must have qualifying pass-through entity income

**Potential savings if applicable:**
- If $50K of pass-through income: $50K × 0.05 = $2,500 now deductible federally
- Federal tax savings: $2,500 × 0.35 = **$875**
- This effectively deducts MA state tax above the $10K SALT cap

### Strategy 4E: Qualified Business Income (199A) Deduction
- Allows 20% deduction on qualified business income from pass-through entities
- Phaseout begins at $394,600 MFJ (2025)
- Fully phased out for specified service trades/businesses (SSTB) above ~$494,600

**Applicability:**
- ❌ Does NOT apply to W-2 wages
- ⚠️ Rental real estate MAY qualify if operated as a business (Rev. Proc. 2019-38 safe harbor: 250 hours of rental services)
- ✅ If you have a non-SSTB business with pass-through income and meet wage/capital tests

**If rental qualifies (unlikely but possible):**
- $15,000 net rental income × 0.20 = $3,000 deduction
- Tax savings: $3,000 × 0.35 = **$1,050**

### Strategy 4F: Charitable Giving — Donor Advised Fund (DAF)
**The power play:** "Bunching" donations using a Donor Advised Fund

**Problem:** At $600K income with $10K SALT cap, you need ~$30K+ in itemized deductions to beat the standard deduction. If you normally donate $5K/year, itemizing barely helps.

**Solution — Bunch 5 years of donations into 1 year:**
1. Open a DAF (Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable, Vanguard)
2. Contribute $25,000 of appreciated stock (5 years × $5K) in one year
3. Take the full $25,000 deduction this year
4. Distribute grants from DAF to charities over the next 5 years
5. Standard deduction in the other 4 years

**Extra benefit — donate appreciated stock:**
- If stock has $15,000 of unrealized gain
- You deduct the full $25,000 fair market value
- You NEVER pay capital gains on the $15,000 gain
- Double tax benefit

**Math:**
- Year 1 (bunch year): Itemize with $25K charity + $10K SALT + $15K mortgage = $50K vs $30K standard = **$20K extra deduction**
- Tax savings: $20,000 × 0.35 = **$7,000 federal**
- Plus avoided capital gains: $15,000 × 0.15 = **$2,250**
- **Total: ~$9,250** (spread over 5 years = ~$1,850/year average)

### Strategy 4G: Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)
For larger amounts or investment property with large gains:

- Transfer appreciated property into CRT
- CRT sells property tax-free (no capital gains at trust level)
- CRT pays you income stream for life (or term of years)
- Remainder goes to charity
- You get a partial charitable deduction upfront

**When it makes sense:** Holding $500K+ of highly appreciated assets you want to diversify.

**Example:**
- Transfer $500K property (basis $200K) to CRT
- Avoided capital gains: ($500K - $200K) × 0.238 (20% + 3.8% NIIT) = **$71,400**
- Upfront charitable deduction: ~$100K-$200K (depends on payout rate)
- BUT you lose the principal — it goes to charity eventually

## 5. Investment Tax Optimization

### Strategy 5A: Tax-Loss Harvesting
**Concept:** Sell investments at a loss to offset gains, reducing taxable investment income.

**Rules:**
- **Wash sale rule:** Cannot buy "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale
- Replace with a similar (not identical) fund: e.g., sell Vanguard S&P 500 → buy Schwab S&P 500 or Total Market
- No limit on losses used to offset gains
- Up to $3,000 of net losses can offset ordinary income ($1,500 MFS)
- Excess carries forward indefinitely

**Math example:**
- Harvest $20,000 in losses
- Offset $15,000 in capital gains + $3,000 ordinary income + $2,000 carries forward
- Gains tax avoided: $15,000 × 0.15 (LTCG) = **$2,250**
- Ordinary income tax avoided: $3,000 × 0.35 = **$1,050**
- NIIT reduction: $18,000 × 0.038 = **$684**
- **Total: ~$3,984**

**Best practices:**
- Harvest throughout the year, not just December
- Use tax lots (specific identification method)
- Watch wash sale across all accounts (including spouse's)
- Keep a spreadsheet tracking cost basis

### Strategy 5B: Asset Location (Tax-Efficient Placement)
Place investments optimally across account types:

| Account Type | What to Hold | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **Tax-deferred (401k, Traditional IRA)** | Bonds, REITs, high-dividend stocks | Highest tax items deferred |
| **Tax-free (Roth IRA, Roth 401k)** | Highest growth assets (small-cap, emerging markets) | Tax-free growth maximized |
| **Taxable brokerage** | Tax-efficient index funds, municipal bonds, individual stocks (for harvesting) | Low turnover, qualified dividends, LTCG |

**Estimated savings:** 0.1-0.5% annual return improvement → on $500K portfolio = **$500-$2,500/year**

### Strategy 5C: Municipal Bonds for MA Residents
Massachusetts municipal bonds are **triple tax-free** for MA residents:
1. Federal income tax free
2. MA state income tax free  
3. NIIT exempt (excluded from net investment income)

**Comparison (assuming $100K in bonds):**
| Bond Type | Yield | After-Tax Yield | Annual After-Tax Income |
|-----------|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| Corporate bond | 5.0% | 5.0% × (1 - 0.35 - 0.05 - 0.038) = 2.81% | $2,810 |
| MA Muni bond | 3.5% | 3.5% (tax-free) | $3,500 |

**MA munis produce MORE after-tax income** even at a lower stated yield.

**Tax-equivalent yield formula:** Muni yield ÷ (1 - combined tax rate) = 3.5% ÷ (1 - 0.438) = **6.23%**

You'd need a 6.23% taxable bond to match a 3.5% MA muni.

### Strategy 5D: Qualified Dividends vs. Ordinary Dividends
- **Qualified dividends:** Taxed at LTCG rates (15% at your income; 20% if taxable income > $600,050)
- **Ordinary dividends:** Taxed at ordinary rates (35% at your income)

**Action:** Favor investments that pay qualified dividends in taxable accounts.
- US stocks: typically qualified
- REITs: typically ordinary → hold in tax-deferred accounts
- Foreign stocks: usually qualified if held 60+ days and from treaty countries

**Impact:** On $10K of dividends, qualified vs ordinary saves $10,000 × (0.35 - 0.15) = **$2,000**

### Strategy 5E: 1031 Exchange for Rental Property
When selling rental property, a 1031 exchange defers ALL capital gains and depreciation recapture by reinvesting in a like-kind property.

**Rules:**
- Must identify replacement property within **45 days** of sale
- Must close on replacement within **180 days** of sale
- Must use a Qualified Intermediary (QI) — cannot touch the cash
- Like-kind: any real property for real property (very broad)
- Must be investment/business property (not primary residence)

**Example:**
- Sell rental for $700K (basis $400K after depreciation)
- Gain: $300K
- Tax deferred: $300K × 0.238 (20% + 3.8% NIIT) = **$71,400 federal**
- Depreciation recapture deferred: $100K × 0.25 = **$25,000**
- MA tax deferred: $300K × 0.05 = **$15,000**
- **Total deferred: ~$111,400**

**Strategy:** "Swap till you drop" — keep doing 1031 exchanges, then at death, heirs get stepped-up basis and ALL deferred gains are eliminated.

### Strategy 5F: Opportunity Zone Investments
Invest capital gains in a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund:

**2025 benefits (reduced from original):**
- ❌ No longer a 10% or 15% reduction in original gain (those required investment by 2021/2026)
- ✅ If held 10+ years: NO tax on appreciation of OZ investment
- Must invest within 180 days of realizing capital gain

**When worth considering:** If you have large capital gains AND a 10+ year horizon AND find a quality OZ fund.

## 6. Itemized Deductions Optimization

### Strategy 6A: Itemize vs. Standard Deduction Analysis
**2025 Standard Deduction (MFJ): $30,000**

You should itemize if total itemized deductions > $30,000.

| Deduction | Your Estimate | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| SALT (capped) | $10,000 | Property tax + state income tax, capped |
| Mortgage interest (primary residence) | $15,000-$25,000 | On up to $750K of acquisition debt |
| Charitable contributions | $5,000-$25,000 | Higher in bunching years |
| Medical expenses | Usually $0 | Must exceed 7.5% of AGI = $45,000 threshold |
| **Total** | **$30,000-$60,000** | |

**If bunching charity:** Itemize in bunching year, standard deduction in off years.

### Strategy 6B: SALT Cap Strategies
**The $10,000 cap** limits deduction for state income tax + local property tax combined.

**Your likely SALT before cap:** MA income tax (~$30K) + property tax (~$10K) = ~$40K
**Your deduction:** $10,000 (cap)
**Lost deduction:** $30,000

**Workarounds:**
1. **MA PTE Election** (see 4D above) — if applicable
2. **Prepay or defer property taxes** — limited benefit given cap
3. **No workaround for W-2 wages** — the cap simply applies
4. **Rental property taxes are NOT subject to SALT cap** — deducted on Schedule E separately

### Strategy 6C: Mortgage Interest Optimization
**Primary residence:**
- Deductible on mortgages up to $750,000 (loans after 12/15/2017)
- Older loans: up to $1,000,000
- Only acquisition indebtedness (purchase, build, substantially improve)
- Home equity loan interest: only deductible if used to buy/build/improve the home

**Rental property:**
- Mortgage interest is FULLY deductible on Schedule E
- No cap on amount
- Not subject to SALT limitations

**Strategy:** If you need to borrow, borrow against rental property (fully deductible) rather than primary residence (subject to limits).

### Strategy 6D: Medical Expense Deduction
- Threshold: 7.5% of AGI
- At $600K AGI: must exceed **$45,000** in medical expenses
- **Realistically: this rarely applies at your income level**
- Exception: major medical event, expensive dental/vision not covered by insurance

### Strategy 6E: Investment Interest Expense Deduction
- If you borrow to invest (margin interest), it's deductible against net investment income
- Limited to net investment income (excess carries forward)
- Does NOT include interest on tax-exempt investments

## 7. Massachusetts State Tax Specifics

### MA Tax Rates (2025)
| Income Type | Rate | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Earned income | 5.0% | Flat rate |
| Interest and dividends (Part B) | 5.0% | Same flat rate |
| Short-term capital gains (≤1 year) | 8.5% | Higher rate! |
| Long-term capital gains (>1 year) | 5.0% | Same as ordinary |
| **Millionaire's Surtax** | **+4% on income > $1M** | Added by 2022 ballot measure |

### Millionaire's Surtax (Fair Share Amendment)
- Additional 4% on taxable income exceeding $1,000,000
- Indexed for inflation (threshold may be slightly above $1M for 2025)
- Applies to ALL income types
- **At $600K income: NOT applicable**
- **Planning trigger:** If income could approach $1M (large capital gain, stock vesting), consider timing/deferral strategies

### MA Rental Income
- Taxed at 5% flat rate (same as other Part B income)
- MA does NOT conform to all federal depreciation rules — check MA-specific adjustments
- MA does not allow federal bonus depreciation (Section 168(k)) — must add back on MA return
- MA does allow standard depreciation (straight-line)

### MA Capital Gains
- **Short-term (≤ 1 year): 8.5%** — significantly higher than ordinary MA rate
- **Long-term (> 1 year): 5.0%**
- **Strategy:** ALWAYS hold investments > 1 year to save 3.5% MA tax on gains
- On $50K STCG vs LTCG: saves $50,000 × 0.035 = **$1,750 MA + federal savings**

### MA-Specific Deductions and Credits
| Item | Amount/Rate | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Rent deduction (renters only) | 50% of rent, up to $4,000 | Not applicable if homeowner |
| Commuter expense deduction | Up to $750 | Transit passes |
| Dependent care credit | Various | Check MA Form 1 instructions |
| Solar/renewable energy credit | 15% of cost, up to $1,000 | If applicable |
| Lead paint abatement credit | Various | If applicable to rental |

### MA Estimated Tax Requirements
- Must pay estimated tax if MA tax liability > $400
- Quarterly due dates: April 15, June 15, Sept 15, Jan 15
- Safe harbor: pay 80% of current year tax OR 100% of prior year tax
- **Penalty:** If underpayment > $400

### ⚠️ Key Warnings

1. **Depreciation recapture is real:** When you sell rental property, depreciation is recaptured at 25% federal rate. Plan for 1031 exchange or hold until death (stepped-up basis).

2. **Pro-rata rule kills many backdoor Roths:** Roll all Traditional IRA money into 401(k) BEFORE year-end to avoid this.

3. **REPS audits are aggressive:** IRS frequently challenges REPS claims. If you claim it, your time logs MUST be bulletproof.

4. **MA does NOT conform to bonus depreciation:** You must add back federal bonus depreciation on your MA return. Standard depreciation is fine.

5. **Wash sale applies across spouses:** If you sell a stock for a loss and your spouse buys the same stock within 30 days, the loss is disallowed.

6. **Estimated tax penalties:** With this many deductions, ensure withholding and estimated payments cover 100% of prior year tax or 90% of current year tax.
