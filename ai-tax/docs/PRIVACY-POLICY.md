## 4. Third-Party Data Processing — Anthropic Claude API

### 4.1 How Data is Processed

The Service uses a hybrid processing architecture:

- **Local Processing:** Document uploads are initially processed on our secure servers for file validation, format conversion, and preliminary data extraction.
- **AI Processing via Anthropic Claude API:** Extracted tax data is transmitted to Anthropic's Claude API via encrypted API calls for advanced document parsing, data interpretation, tax calculation assistance, and error checking. Only the minimum data necessary for the specific processing task is transmitted to the API.

### 4.2 Anthropic's Data Practices

We use Anthropic's Claude API under their commercial API terms, which provide the following protections:

- **No Model Training:** Anthropic **does not** use data submitted through the Claude API to train or improve their AI models. Your tax data is not used for machine learning training purposes.
- **Limited Data Retention by Anthropic:** Under Anthropic's API data usage policy, input and output data submitted through the API is retained by Anthropic for a limited period (up to 30 days) solely for safety monitoring and abuse prevention, after which it is deleted. Anthropic does not use your data to train AI models and does not retain your data for any other purpose.
- **Zero Data Sharing:** Anthropic does not share, sell, or disclose API customer data to third parties.

For more information, please review [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) and [API Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/api-terms).

### 4.3 Data Minimization

We employ data minimization practices when transmitting data to the Claude API. Where technically feasible, we tokenize or mask highly sensitive identifiers (such as full SSNs) before transmission, transmitting only the data elements necessary for the specific processing task.

We do **not** sell your personal information. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:
