# Social Sync Automation

**Status:** 📋 TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** 2026-02-03

## Task
Be prepared to implement automated social sync when requested:
- Telegram → Reddit/X (cross-post interesting findings)
- Maintain authenticity (no spam/manipulation)
- Use established APIs/tools (reddit_cli, bird)

## Next Steps
- Wait for user signal to proceed
- When triggered: design workflow, implement automation, test on small scale

## Notes
- User wants this tracked and ready, but not implemented yet
- Will need careful design to avoid violating platform ToS
