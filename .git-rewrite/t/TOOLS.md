# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
