## 2. Service Description

### 2.1 Overview

ai-tax is an AI-assisted tax preparation service that helps users prepare federal and state individual income tax returns. The Service uses artificial intelligence technology, specifically Anthropic's Claude API, to:

- Parse and extract data from uploaded tax documents (W-2, 1099 series, 1098 series, and other IRS forms).
- Assist in calculating tax liability, deductions, credits, and estimated refunds or amounts owed.
- Generate completed tax forms for user review.
- Facilitate electronic filing of tax returns with the IRS and applicable state tax authorities (where supported).

### 2.2 Nature of the Service

**THE SERVICE IS A SOFTWARE TOOL DESIGNED TO ASSIST WITH TAX PREPARATION. IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVICE.**

The Service utilizes AI technology to automate and assist with tax form preparation. While we strive for accuracy, the Service:

- Does **not** provide tax advice, legal advice, financial advice, or accounting services.
- Is **not** a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Enrolled Agent (EA), tax attorney, or licensed tax professional.
- Does **not** guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any calculations, deductions, or tax positions.
- Does **not** represent you before the IRS or any tax authority.

All tax calculations, form selections, and filing positions generated by the Service are **estimates and suggestions** that require your review and approval before filing.

1. Be at least eighteen (18) years of age.
2. Be a U.S. taxpayer with a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).

## 5. Important Disclaimers

### 5.1 Not Professional Tax Advice

**THE SERVICE DOES NOT PROVIDE TAX ADVICE, LEGAL ADVICE, OR PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTING SERVICES. THE AI-GENERATED CALCULATIONS, SUGGESTIONS, AND FORM PREPARATIONS ARE ESTIMATES BASED ON THE DATA YOU PROVIDE AND THE AI'S INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. THEY MAY CONTAIN ERRORS.**

If you have a complex tax situation, including but not limited to business income, foreign income, cryptocurrency transactions, estate or trust matters, or substantial itemized deductions, we strongly recommend that you consult a qualified tax professional before filing.

### 5.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy

While we employ commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our AI-assisted calculations, **we do not warrant or guarantee that any calculation, deduction, credit, or tax position generated by the Service is accurate, complete, or correct.** Tax law is complex and subject to change. The AI may misinterpret data, apply incorrect rules, or produce errors.

### 5.3 No Guarantee of Refund

Any refund estimate provided by the Service is a projection only. The actual refund amount (if any) is determined solely by the IRS and/or applicable state tax authority. We make no guarantee regarding the amount or timing of any refund.

### 5.4 IRS and State Authority Determinations

The IRS and state tax authorities are the final arbiters of your tax liability. The Service's calculations do not bind the IRS or any other taxing authority. You may be subject to additional tax, penalties, or interest as determined by such authorities regardless of the Service's output.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

### 6.1 Limitation of Damages

**(b) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).**

### 6.3 Accuracy Guarantee — Limited Remedy

If the Service produces a calculation error that directly results in an IRS or state penalty or interest charge, and you can demonstrate that (i) you provided accurate and complete information to the Service, (ii) the error was caused by the Service's calculation and not by your data or decisions, and (iii) you filed the return as prepared by the Service without material modification, then our sole and exclusive remedy shall be to reimburse you for documented penalty and interest charges actually paid, up to the lesser of:

- The total amount you paid for the Service for the applicable tax year, or
- Five hundred dollars ($500.00).

To claim this remedy, you must notify us in writing within **sixty (60) days** of receiving the IRS or state notice and provide all supporting documentation. This remedy is your **sole and exclusive remedy** for calculation errors.

### 6.4 Essential Purpose

The limitations set forth in this Section 6 shall apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages; in such jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
